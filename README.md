# GifTastic
In this activity, the objective is to render buttons that display gifs when clicked on. The gifs will be rendered using the Giphy API.

Each time a button is clicked, 10 gifs relating to the button label will appear along with the rating of each gif. When they appear, the gifs will be in a still state and will only be active when clicked on. They will go back to the still state when clicked a second time.

To create a new button, the user will be able to type a new label in the input bar. Clicking on the submit button will take that value and create a new gif button that will function like all the other gif buttons (showing 10 gifs, ratings, etc.)
